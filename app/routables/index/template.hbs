            <p>Julius used to hate golf. Heâ€™d slice his driver 3 fairways to the
              right and end up hitting 140 strokes in a single 18 hole round
              loosing 12 balls. Then he started taking lessons. Now he has more
              irons than rio tinto and more drivers than
              kyle berkshire.</p>

            <p>Absolutely hopeless with the driver, however dreams of having
              better short game than phil mickelson. Love hate relationship. Hate
              the player not the game.</p>

            <p>The only person here with a single digit handicap and
              belongs to a proper golf club. All he does all day long is send
              meaningless gifs to annoy all his golf mates. Also he once threw his
              3 wood further than his golf shot.</p>
