<h1>About</h1>
<p>Weekend warrior about us...Our goal is to improve your swag on the weekends!<br>
When we're not the slaving away at the desk getting slammed by the boss that is overbearing, whom also doesn’t understand the meaning of micro managing, or our significant other (wifey) handing you a note the night before the weekend with chores…. or shouting “the 2 year old birthday party that starts at 2pm”.
Then you’ll find us waking up at the crack of dawn, driving across town, because the only time you’ll spend time with your best mate is that 7am tee time… smelling that freshly cut grass, walking to the 10th tee box looking up that fairway and seeing that thin layer of dew, knowing you’ll see that first putt line narrowly miss the cup for a cheeky birdie after that huge snap hook onto the first fairway, because you’ve just taken a swipe at the ball harder than Bubba Watson.<br>
All worth it! Having just pulled out your newly purchased second hand big kahuna nostalgic excalibur 913D driver with that sexy Tour AD 60g Blue Bullet shaft with a miura cord grip...
We’re a group of mates which are into that fresh powder every year winter comes around, that group of mates that hit the roads in the wee hours of saturday morning driving up the Initial D mountain course, breathing that fresh cold air that feels like your lungs, nose and throat are burning with every breath.<br>
Catching that first chair lift to the summit knowing that you’re going to be the first to shred that mountain side, clipping on your newly waxed board and those bright new threads that makes you distinguishable to your mates. That exhilarating feeling of freedom to pick and choose your best lines through the trees, what to wear, ride, and listen to makes you feel alive.<br>
Well golf isn’t like that but in so many ways it is… we’re not here to teach you all that bull…. When it comes to your swing, you know what works for you! Aim as far left as you can without hitting that tree and swing as fast you can and watch that nice big power fade hit the middle of the fairway and end up on the fringe of the right… fair hit!<br>
We know you're kitted out with drinks in the cooler bag, those nice new threads from J Lindeberg, the new Jordan lined golf shoe from Nike, the latest “new” ProV1x ball which is the old ProV ball...but you always feel there's something missing about your game….<br>
SWAGGER is why you're here!!!!...... looking through ‘the collection of cult-like’ nostalgic weapons of choice for your weekend journey becoming the warrior amongst your mates...</p>
